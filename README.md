Addition: Adds two integers.

Algorithm:

Take two integers as input.

Sum the integers.

Output the result.

Subtraction: Subtracts one integer from another.

Algorithm:

Take two integers as input.

Subtract the second integer from the first.

Output the result.

Multiplication: Multiplies two integers.

Algorithm:

Take two integers as input.

Multiply the integers.

Output the result.

Division: Divides one integer by another, with a check to prevent division by zero.

Algorithm:

Take two integers as input.

Check if the second integer is zero.

If zero, output an error message.

If not, divide the first integer by the second.

Output the result.

Palindrome Check: Determines if a given number reads the same backward as forward.

Algorithm:

Take an integer as input.

Initialize a variable to store the reversed number.

Reverse the digits of the input number.

Compare the reversed number with the original.

If equal, it is a palindrome.

If not equal, it is not a palindrome.

Output the result.

Armstrong Number Check: Checks if a number is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Algorithm:

Take an integer as input.

Initialize a variable to store the sum of the digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

For each digit in the number:

Raise the digit to the power of the number of digits and add to the sum.

Compare the sum with the original number.

If equal, it is an Armstrong number.

If not equal, it is not an Armstrong number.

Output the result.

Sorting an Array: Arranges the elements of an array in ascending order.

Algorithm:

Take an array and its size as input.

For each element in the array:

Compare it with every other element.

Swap elements if they are in the wrong order.

Output the sorted array.

Binary Search: Efficiently finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

Algorithm:

Take a sorted array, its size, and a key to search as input.

Initialize low and high pointers to the beginning and end of the array.

While low is less than or equal to high:

Calculate the mid-point.

If the mid-point value equals the key, return the mid-point index.

If the key is less than the mid-point value, adjust the high pointer to mid-1.

If the key is greater than the mid-point value, adjust the low pointer to mid+1.

If the key is not found, return -1.
